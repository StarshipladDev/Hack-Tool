# Starshiplad's Hacktool
Unzip Executable folder(Called 'Release'), run .exe with a SQL unsecure html request that has 3 values requested via GET.
Sample data:
http://www.starshiplad.com/search.php?testsearch=REEE

*Current Issues*
Currently the program requires a vlaid URL with GET request- try/catch blocks are missign a componenet that
exits on invalid URL.

The URL provided requires exactly 3 parameters. This will be changed in the UML documentation update
